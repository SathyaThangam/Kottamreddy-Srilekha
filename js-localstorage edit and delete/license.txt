To make a warranty claim, you must return the Product to the location where you obtained it along with proof of purchase within such thirty (30) day period of the license fee you paid for the Product. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. 
   2. Customer Remedies.  The Licensor and its suppliers’ entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of the foregoing warranty shall be at the Licensor’s option: (i) return of the purchase price paid for the License, if any, or (ii) correction of the defects, “bugs” or errors within reasonable period of time.  You must return the defective media to the Licensor at your expense with a copy of your receipt.  This limited warranty is void if the defect has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES IN ANY ONE OR MORE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCT.  THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
